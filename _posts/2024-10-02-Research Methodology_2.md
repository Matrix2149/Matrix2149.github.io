# $\color{purple}{Creative\,Thinking}$
## 科研三大要素
1. 训练与经验
2. IQ：遗传+环境
3. 动机、气质、Constructive dissatisfication：把事情搞明白，好奇、快乐  

## 解决问题的思考方法（好的研究者潜移默化运用）
- 简化：突出问题本质、关键
- **类比：从相似工作与问题中获得灵感，案例越多，相互发生的链接越多，获得灵感越容易**，That's why experience in a field is important!
- 重构：换角度、换形式、换方法重新表述，理解问题
- 外推：思考更广泛的情况（尤其适用数学）
- 结构化分析（拆分）：把大问题用一组结构理解分析，拆分成一组小问题，从小处着手，一步步推进
- 反解：假设问题解决，需要什么条件？问题与条件互换

## 用反馈推动工作

## What is a PhD?
- An advanced graduate degree awarded for **demonstrable ability to do research**. 
- research=the production of new knowledge 

## PhD years: the time of disillusionment
- New students typically think they know everything。
- I have bad news for you. During your PhD, you will find out:
	1. there are people who are better than you
    2. you are not good at everything. Play to your strengths!
    3. life is unfair：people who are not as smart or hard-working will be
    luckier and end up with better results; people who have done worse work will end up with
    better jobs because of their field/advisor
    4. More bad news:being good at courses is not enough; doing what you are told may not be enough

## PhD years: the time of insecurity
why do all the people around me publish and I don't?
- concentrate on what you do and do not try to evaluate yourselves with post-PhD criteria

## How to Pick an Area
**Luke: Is the dark side stronger?**

**Yoda: No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.**

### !!! Different kinds of research
#### scientific research = research based on analysis
- analyze until you find the most fundamental parts, even if working with them does not resemble working on the original problem

#### engineering research = research based on synthesis
- compose many small solutions into a single big one 

### Predicting the Future
#### Future employability should not be your primary criterion
- it is impossible to predict the future very accurately
- in the 80s AI was hot; in the early 90s it was
multimedia; now it is security and biocomputing
- many students find that the area that was hot when
they started is saturated when they graduate

### Concentrate on Mode of Research
#### Make sure you like the mode of research in an area
- is it theoretical or applied?
- what flavor do the intellectual results have? Does
this inspire you?
- what do you have to do every day? Code? Think?
